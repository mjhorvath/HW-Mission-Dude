This is an old level editor I created for Homeworld 2 in the 2000s. It relies 
on several very obsolete technologies, including:

* Windows Scripting Host (WSH)
* HTML Applications (HTA)
* Adobe SVG Viewer

If I find the time, I would like to update it to run in a regular browser 
window instead of the desktop. I also would like to update it to work with 
Homeworld Remastered.

Further information can be found in "HW2_MissionDude_readme.txt". This includes 
installation and usage instructions, as well as an update history. I have 
confirmed the program works in Windows 7, but do not know if it works in 
Windows 8/8.1/10.

I uploaded a video to YouTube describing how to install the program:
