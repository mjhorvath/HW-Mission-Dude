This is an old level editor I created for Homeworld 2 in the 2000s. It relies 
on several very obsolete technologies, including:

* Windows Scripting Host (WSH)
* HTML Applications (HTA)
* Adobe SVG Viewer

If I find the time to update it, I would like to make it run in a regular 
browser Window, and output to the screen instead of a file. I also would like 
to update it to work for Homeworld Remastered.
