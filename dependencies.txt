In order for this program to work properly, it requires the following things:

* Adobe SVG Viewer, latest version
  https://www.adobe.com/devnet/svg/adobe-svg-viewer-download-area.html
* "cjDialogs.dll"
  I can no longer find this on the Web, so I have included it with this program.
  I do not have the source for this library. I do not remember what the license 
  was originally. Some sort of "free for for noncommercial use" license 
  presumably.
* "Lua4.exe" and "Luac4.exe"
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/
  These go into the "source/lua" directory.
* A version of the MS Windows operating system that supports HTML Applications 
  (HTA) and Windows Scripting Host (WSH). I have not tested on Windows 8/8.1/10 
  but I know the program works on Windows 7.
